It was Reygadas' debut feature, which was shot on anamorphic 16-millimeter film in a 2.88:1 screen aspect ratio.\n\nPlot summary\nThe film follows a man going through an acute existential crisis. He leaves Mexico City to go out to the country and prepare for his death,  staying with an old indigenous widow in her ramshackle home overlooking a desolate canyon. In the vastness of a wild and impressive nature, he confronts the infinite humanity of the widow and oscillates between cruelty and lyricism. His senses become dull, arousing his desires and instincts for sexuality and life.\n\nReception\nJap\u00f3n received high accolades from most critics who have seen it, but the film has had relatively limited exposure.  It was placed at #100 on The Moving Arts Film Journal's list of the 100 greatest films of all time. The film also won the special mention of the Camera d'Or prize in the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 80% approval based on 25 reviews from critics, with a \"Certified Fresh\" rating.\n\nControversy\nJap\u00f3n contains a number of scenes of real animal cruelty and the British Board of Film Classification demanded cuts for its UK release in accordance with the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937.  The removed scenes are described as an unsuccessful attempt to strangle a bird that then stumbles around injured on the ground and a dog being forced to sing along with a song through the application of a painful stimulus. The film also includes an unsimulated scene of a bird being shot down and then killed by having its head torn off and the (off-camera) slaughter of a pig. Reygadas defended these scenes, as well as the explicit sexual encounters in Batalla en el Cielo, saying, \"If you think about it, what\u2019s so outrageous about a naked obese woman? There are plenty of astonishing images in other films with flying cars and such\u2026 What you see in my films, you can see it any ordinary day: a gas station, a hunter killing an animal, people making love. I\u2019m not trying to impress anyone with those images; they make sense in the context of my films.\"\n\nAwards\n2002 International Film Festival Bratislava, Grand Prix for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 International Film Festival Bratislava, Prize of the Ecumenical Jury for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 Cannes Film Festival, Golden Camera - Special Mention for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 Edinburgh International Film Festival, New Director's Award for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival, Best Latin American Film for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival, Critics Award - Honorable Mention for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Best Director for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 Stockholm International Film Festival, Audience Award for Carlos Reygadas\n2002 Havana Film Festival, Best First Work for Carlos Reygadas\n2003 Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival, Aurora Award - Special Mention for Carlos Reygadas\n2003 Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, Best Actor for Alejandro Ferretis\n2003 Guadalajara International Film Festival, Best Screenplay for Carlos Reygadas\n2003 Guadalajara International Film Festival, Best Art Direction for Alejandro Reygadas\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nJap\u00f3n at IMDb\nJap\u00f3n at Rotten Tomatoes\nJap\u00f3n: On Seeing Ourselves Seeing an essay by Valeria Luiselli at the Criterion Collection"
